This is the second app that i created during my Native Android Learning Experience, where I have learned about the Volley Api and Glide Library and implemented both of them in this app, This app fetches memes from the reddit using an api and display them over the screen which is sharable by the user. The next modifications would be to share the meme directly as an image and not as an url, and the other changes would include left right swipe gestures to go to the next/previous meme.
